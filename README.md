> Provides a mock source for writeable streams.


## Installation

``` bash
$ npm install flow-mock-write
```

For use in the browser, use [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).


## Usage

To create a mock readable stream,

``` javascript
var mock = require( 'flow-mock-write' );
```

The method accepts two input arguments: an array of values to write and a writeable stream.

``` javascript
var eventStream = require( 'event-stream' );

// Simulate some data:
var data = new Array( 100 );

for ( var i = 0; i < data.length; i++ ) {
	data[ i ] = Math.random()*100;
}

// Create a writeable stream:
var writeable = eventStream.map( function( d, clbk ){
		clbk( null, d.toString()+'\n' );
	});

// Pipe to standard out:
writeable.pipe( process.stdout );

// Start streaming...
mock( data, writeable );
```


## Examples

To run the example code from the top-level application directory,

``` bash
$ node ./examples/index.js
```


## Tests

### Unit

Unit tests use the [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha) test framework with [Chai](http://chaijs.com) assertions. To run the tests, execute the following command in the top-level application directory:

``` bash
$ make test
```

All new feature development should have corresponding unit tests to validate correct functionality.


### Test Coverage

This repository uses [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) as its code coverage tool. To generate a test coverage report, execute the following command in the top-level application directory:

``` bash
$ make test-cov
```

Istanbul creates a `./reports/coverage` directory. To access an HTML version of the report,

``` bash
$ open reports/coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```
